# IBM Cloud Satellite location on AWS

Use this terrafrom automation to set up satellite location on IBM cloud with AWS host.
It will provision satellite location and create 6 EC2 host and assign 3 host to control plane, and provision ROKS satellite cluster and auto assign 3 host to cluster,
Configure cluster worker pool to an existing ROKS satellite cluster.

This is a collection of modules that make it easier to provision a satellite on IBM Cloud.
* satellite-location
* satellite-location-ec2
* satellite-cluster-ec2
* satellite-assign-host
* satellite-cluster
* satellite-cluster-worker-pool

## Overview

IBM CloudÂ® Satellite helps you deploy and run applications consistently across all on-premises, edge computing and public cloud environments from any cloud vendor. It standardizes a core set of Kubernetes, data, AI and security services to be centrally managed as a service by IBM Cloud, with full visibility across all environments through a single pane of glass. The result is greater developer productivity and development velocity.

## Features

- Create satellite location.
- Create 6 EC2 host with RHEL 7.7.
- Assign the 3 hosts to the location control plane.
- *Conditional creation*:
  * Create a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster and assign the 3 hosts to the cluster, so that you can run OpenShift workloads in your location.
  * Configure a worker pool to an existing OpenShift Cluster.

## Usage

```
terraform init
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```
```
terraform destroy
```

## Example Usage
``` hcl
provider "ibm" {
}

provider "aws" {
  region     = var.aws_region
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key
}

module "satellite-aws" {
  source  = "terraform-ibm-modules/satellite-aws/ibm"
  version = "1.0.0"

  ibmcloud_api_key           = var.ibmcloud_api_key #pragma: allowlist secret
  aws_region                 = var.aws_region
  aws_access_key             = var.aws_access_key
  aws_secret_key             = var.aws_secret_key
  resource_group             = var.resource_group
  is_location_exist          = var.is_location_exist
  location                   = var.location
  managed_from               = var.managed_from
  location_zones             = var.location_zones
  location_bucket            = var.location_bucket
  host_labels                = var.host_labels
  host_provider              = "aws"
  create_cluster             = var.create_cluster
  cluster                    = var.cluster
  cluster_host_labels        = var.cluster_host_labels
  create_cluster_worker_pool = var.create_cluster_worker_pool
  worker_pool_name           = var.worker_pool_name
  worker_pool_host_labels    = var.worker_pool_host_labels
  create_timeout             = var.create_timeout
  update_timeout             = var.update_timeout
  delete_timeout             = var.delete_timeout
}
```

## Note

* `satellite-location` module creates new location or use existing location ID/name to process. If user pass the location which is already exist,   satellite-location module will error out and exit the module. In such cases user has to set `is_location_exist` value to true. So that module will use existing location for processing.
* `satellite-location` module download attach host script to the $HOME directory and appends respective permissions to the script.
* `satellite-location` module will update the attach host script and will be used in the `user_data` attribute of EC2 module.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Run the following command to execute the pre-commit hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file

  `pre-commit run -a`

We can install pre-coomit tool using

  `pip install pre-commit`

## How to input varaible values through a file

To review the plan for the configuration defined (no resources actually provisioned)

`terraform plan -var-file=./input.tfvars`

To execute and start building the configuration defined in the plan (provisions resources)

`terraform apply -var-file=./input.tfvars`

To destroy the VPC and all related resources

`terraform destroy -var-file=./input.tfvars`

All optional parameters by default will be set to null in respective example's varaible.tf file. If user wants to configure any optional paramter he has overwrite the default value.
